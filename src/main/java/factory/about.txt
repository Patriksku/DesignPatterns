* When a method returns one of several possible classes that share a common super class.

    - Create a new enemy in a game
    - RNG picks a number assigned to a specific enemy
    - The factory returns the enemy-object associated with that number.

* The class is chosen at run-time.


When to use:
    - When you do not know ahead of time what class object you need.
    - When all of the potential classes are in the same subclass hierarchy.
    - To centralize class selection code.
    - When you do not want the user to have to know every subclass.
    - To encapsulate object creation.
