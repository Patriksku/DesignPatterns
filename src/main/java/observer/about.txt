* When you need many other objects to receive an update when another object changes:

    - Stock market with thousands of stocks need to send updates to objects representing individual stocks.
    - The Subject (publisher) sends many stocks to the Observers.
    - The Observers (subscribers) takes the ones they want and use them.

--> Loose coupling
    - The Subject (publisher) does not need to know anything about the Observer (subscriber)

Negatives: The Subject (publisher) may send updates that do not matter to the Observer (subscriber).
